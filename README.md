# Spatial-Augmented-Reality-Sandbox
Spatial Augmented Reality Sandbox that allow users to play with the sand and the system responds in real time topological mapping. Additionally, the system is buttonless. Users start, change mode and end the program by hand gestures. In this model, Kinect is used for depth reading and Leap Motion for hand gesture recognition. 

Main.cpp File utilizes Kinect object for depth reading and Leap Motion object for hand gestures recognition.
In order to do this, you must have Kinect SDK and Leap Motion SDK downloaded on your computer and added properly in references.

Additionally, OpenGL's 'freeglut' library is used for Topological Mapping on the sand.
Make sure to add that to your system/program's references.
